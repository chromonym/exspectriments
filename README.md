# Exspectriments

A simple addon mod for [Spectrum](https://modrinth.com/mod/spectrum) intended for use on the Silly SMP.

Adds:

- Lab Coats (one of which requires [Rose's Thorntilities](https://modrinth.com/mod/roses-thorntilities) to be survival-obtainable)
- A method of getting certain hostile drops without having to deal with mobs
- Invisible Armor (for use with any cosmetic armor mod)
- A new potion effect
- A printer (for more control over the color of dyeable items)
- Liquid Gems
  - A process to decraft vanilla-style gem blocks that involves liquid gems

Fixes:

- The Bedrock Armor cape part not hiding when a cosmetic armor is applied (with [this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cosmetic-armor), at least)
  - Ears mod tails not behaving properly with Spectrum's armors and Cosmetic Armor in combination
